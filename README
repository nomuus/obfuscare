                            `                                    `-[ Python ]-`

This script was written in a mere night in order to provide simple yet effective
means of obfuscating a plain-text file.  After sitting unused for several months
it was decided that it should be slightly reworked into a usable tool.  In the 
current design it will take a user-supplied plain-text file and map the letters
to a pseudorandom buffer of obfuscated text or map to a user-supplied key file.
Once the characters have been mapped, a pseudorandom list of corresponding
indices is output.

The concept itself closely resembles that of codebooks.  Once generated, the
indices or key text (obfuscated text) can be separately stored then reassembled
using a loader tool.  The interesting aspect is that the key text can be any
plain-text file so long as it has all corresponding characters.  Without the
indices the original text cannot be recovered and the file appears normal; the
same can be applied to having the indices but not having the original key
obfuscation text.

Although Obfuscare is not a fully fleshed out tool and the concept itself is by
no means new, it can provide a subtle way of distributing information or hiding
it in plain sight.
